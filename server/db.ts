 * Handing an order to whatever the restaurant already bills on.
 *
 * There is no standard for this. A kitchen in Indore might run Petpooja or
 * POSist, a Windows billing program from 2011, a spreadsheet, or a notebook —
 * and Khapee cannot integrate with each of them, nor should it try: an
 * integration per product is a list that is never finished and is wrong the
 * week a restaurant switches.
 *
 * So the order is published in the three shapes that between them reach
 * anything. A webhook pushes each order to a URL as it happens, which is what
 * a modern POS wants. A key lets a system that cannot receive a push pull
 * instead, which is what an on-premises till wants. And a CSV covers the rest,
 * including the notebook. The restaurant chooses; Khapee depends on none of
 * them and nothing here is billed to anybody.
