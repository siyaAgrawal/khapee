/**
 * The five endpoints Petpooja calls on us.
 *
 * Their documentation gives these no authentication of any kind — a POST with
 * a restID in the body, and whoever knows the restID can push a menu or
 * cancel an order. A restID is six digits printed on the restaurant's own
 * paperwork, so that is not a secret and cannot be treated as one.
 *
 * The secret is therefore the URL. Each restaurant gets its own random
 * webhook path, generated when the link is made and handed to Petpooja during
 * setup, and the path is what identifies the restaurant — the restID in the
 * body is checked against it and a mismatch is refused. Nothing here trusts a
 * payload to say who it is about.
 *
 * Mounted before the API's no-store header and outside every auth middleware,
 * because the caller is a machine in Ahmedabad with no session.
